## Usage and target

TourGuide is an opensource project to build tour guide mobile app for iOS & android. It is developed with Appcelerator Titanium Alloy SDK.

TourGuide is meant to build dedicated mobile apps that will be brought to end customers through Apple Appstore or Google PlayStore. Those mobile apps will be tourguide for visitor in a museum, historical place, exhibition, gallery...

To achieve this goal, you have to produce a TourML content. For now, this can be done with Tap-CMS, available at http://tapintomuseums.org/

Create a TourML bundle (like the ones used in TAP-iOS) and deposit it at app/assets/tourml/
You would then have to configure TourGuide : app/lib/data/app.json

## Tour Samples

Contents in app/assets/tourml like Eglise.bundle (and its subdirectories) or Village.bundle contains copyrighted materials. They are presented here just as ullustrations and to allow fully working compilation tests.

## TourML bundles & TAP apps

The format TourGuide uses for tour publishing is TourML, documented & released at http://tapintomuseums.org/

## Funding

TourGuide is a private initiative, lead by id√©esculture, a small french company, involved in opensource project & services for museums & touring sites.
We provide services mostly in France & french-speaking, with CollectiveAccess (http://www.collectiveaccess.org) among other opensource cultural tools.
